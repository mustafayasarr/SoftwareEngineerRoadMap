## **Getting started**

<details open>
  <summary>Let's first get to know why do we need this thing ü•∏ | <b>Click to expand</b></summary>
</br>

### **Why do you need any of this**

Altough math is not required for most **software engineering** tasks, it certainly will not hurt you to have a background in math, While there may not be much directly transferable information between **math** classes and typical **software engineering** activities, the process of learning and doing math helps you build important problem-solving skills, 

and while it may sound daunting to learn all of these software engineering topics, the important thing to note is that none of these directly relate to math. While they may have theoretical roots in mathematical fields, none of them require you to know math to become proficient.

And finally most of the required knowledge for these technologies is self-contained, and will not require you to draw from theoretical content taught in university-level courses.

Fundamentally, software engineering involves solving problems by writing code and designing software systems. Similarly, math, particularly proof-based math, involves solving problems by writing a series of correct statements in mathematical language.


At a high level, both of these activities involve translating logic and facts into some kind of expressed language. And in both situations, logical consistency and correctness are of the utmost importance.

However, this is not unique to math. Many other fields, such as philosophy, and other STEM fields such as physics, also involve similar skills. Even other activities, such as playing certain video games or solving puzzles, require similar logic and problem-solving skills.

Math is only one of many activities that allow software engineers to build up their critical thinking skills outside of programming.

### **Math Applications in software engineering**

As a complicated field, there are various types of math in computer science. Computer science examines the principles and use of computers in processing information, designing softwares, and using applications. Possessing a strong foundational knowledge of mathematics is vital to gaining an understanding of how computers work. (But still not necessary ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)


- Problems solving skills
- Asymptotic analysis
- Data science
- Artificial intelligince
- Machine learning
- Image processing

### **Math Myths that you need to get over before they own you**:

<br/>

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/XdORe0Wi4E1CuXP2Nm/giphy.gif)

- Not everyone is capable of learning math
- Math is only about memorization
- Math isn‚Äôt supposed to be fun
- Math is something you do alone
- People are too old to learn math
- Men are better in math than women
- Math requires logic, not intuition
- Math is not creative
- You must always know how you got the answer
- There is a best way to do math problems
- it's always important to get the answer exactly right
- it's bad to count on your fingers
- Mathematicians do problems quickly, in their heads
- Math requires a good memory
- Math is done by working intensely until the problem is solved
- Some people have a "math mind" and some don't
- There is a magic key to doing math
- I need serious math skills to learn how to become a software engineer
- I need serious math skills to learn how to become a software engineer

Belief in myths about how math is done leads to a complete lack of self-confidence. But it is self-confidence that is one of the most important determining factors in mathematical performance. We have yet to encounter anyone who could not attain his or her goals once the emotional blocks were removed.


<br/>

> **Recap**: 
> So a final word ANYONE of any age can learn as much math as they want as long as they do it in the correct order (no sense starting at algebra when you haven't done pre-alegebra) and are willing to invest **the time** to really understand it, and that's it, and it is absolutely just like learning any other new skill, it will take time and it will eventually pay off.
