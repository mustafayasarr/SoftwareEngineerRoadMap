  ## **What is Automated Software Testing**


</div>

**Automated Software Testing** is  process/ technique where a Tester writes tools, scripts, and software to perform test cases by repeating pre-defined actions that allows to execute repetitive task without intervention of Manual Tester. Test Automation focuses on replacing manual human activity with systems or devices. Because automated testing is done through an automation tool, it consumes less time in exploratory tests and more time in maintaining test scripts while increasing overall test coverage 

- The software testing industry involves two different kinds of testing Manual and Automated. There are distinct differences between the testing types. Manual testing requires physical time and effort to ensure the software code does everything. Also, manual testers have to make a record of their findings.

- The benefit of manual testing is that it allows a human mind to draw insights from a test that might otherwise be missed by an automated testing program. 
- Automated testing is most preferable for large projects that require testing the same areas over and over. Also, projects that have already been through an initial manual testing process and it is an Automated Process of a Manual Process üòâ

- The test automation performs testing at three different levels:

  - Unit Level Automation
  - API Testing
  - User Interface

<br>

**Automated Software Testing** has many benefits for app testing cycles. This allows you to build better apps with less effort. Also, it is less time-consuming. Many companies still run only manual tests as they are now aware of how to properly integrate automated testing in their app development process. 

---

<br>


### **Some of the reasons why Automation Testing is important:**

<br>

- **Running Tests 24/7**: You can start the test from anywhere in the world and anytime you want to. You can even do that remotely if you don‚Äôt have a lot of devices or you don‚Äôt have the possibility to buy them.

- **Fewer Human Resources**: You just need a test automation engineer to write your scripts to automate your tests, instead of a lot of people doing boring manual tests over and over again.
- **Reusability**: The scripts are reusable and you don‚Äôt need new scripts every time. Also, you can redo the steps that are exactly as the previous ones.
- **Bugs**: Automation helps you find bugs in the early stages of software development, reducing expenses and working hours to fix these problems as well.
- **Reliability**: Automated testing is more reliable and way quicker when running boring repetitive standardized tests which can not be skipped, but may cause errors when manually tested.

### **Difference between Manual & Automation Testing**

<details>
  <summary>Difference between Manual & Automation Testing <b>Click to expand</b></summary>

 <br>
 
|Features |	Manual Testing |	Automation Testing|
|----------|---------------|--------------------|
|**Accuracy & Reliability** | Not accurate at all times due to Human Error, Therefore Less Reliable. | Since it is performed by third party tools and/or Scripts, therefore More Reliable.
**Time required** | Time Consuming. | Faster than Manual Testing as it is executed by Tools.|
**Investment Cost** | Return of Investment(ROI) is low heavy Investment for Human Resources. | Return of Investment(ROI) is high investment for Tools rather than for Human Resources.
|**Usage**|Suitable for Exploratory, Usability and Ad hoc Testing |	Suitable for  Regression Testing, Performance Testing, Load Testing.| 
**Human Element** | It allows for Careful Human observation to find out any glitches |	No human observation involved and a practical option when test cases are run repeatedly.|
**Customer Experience** | Helps in improving the customer experience | No guarantee of positive customer experience
