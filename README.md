## **Why is it 🙋🏽**

The reasons behind building Sengineer.io:

Sengineer.io was originally created as a guide for learning Algorithms and Data Structres in July 2018, but after starting to digitally document my Software Engineering learning Journey, cause i'm not that good with documenting it using a pen and paper, and as a result to the initial idea the project grew to the fully inclusive Software engineering Bachelor's modules you can see, which can be your to-go place for becoming a solid Software engineer whatever your speciality is. 

And finally to answer the (``` Why is it``` ): The internet is full of resources that are overwhelming long and mostly (Only) theoretical, and when it coems to learning Software Engineering aside from the (Web development) endless courses who mostly have (Learn Software engineering) title, there is still no concrete one fully documented resource mainly depend, and not that you won't navigate through endless resources during your learning jopurney, but Sengineer.io will always be your inital Guide and Point, and that's the simplest aim of Sengineer.io 🦾
